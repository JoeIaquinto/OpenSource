2. Keep researching you problem after you ask the question. you may find the solution elsewhere. if you find the solution elsewhere, make sure to post it wherever you asked your question.

#Potential Project:
I havent given to much thought into a potential project yet, but I would like to do something related to the pebble watch. Some sort of watchapp that connects to your computer or phone or website in some interesting way. I could possible do something with the IFTTT "Do" button. Another thing that I would love to do would be to create a jailbreak tweak for the iPhone. I don't know exactly what i would want to tweak, but its an idea.
